The aim of the projest was to answer some busines questions about online movie rental platform in order to prepare and introduce a new product. For this, a SQL database needed to be querried.
Here, I provide a few examples of such querries performed to answer specific busines questions.

## The SQL querry file
This [file](SQL%20query) shows how to query the SQL database to answer a busines question how to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.

## The Common Table Expression file 
This [file]() exemplifies the use of CTE in a SQL querry to answer the same busines question as in SQL query file.

## Tableau report
I have also prepared an analysis of the platform sales data and visualized it in Tableau:
